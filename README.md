# py_fib_archive
A personal collection of implementations of the fibonacci sequence.

##
The fibonacci sequence is rather well-understood mathematically. In particular, there is a "closed form" solution for the formula that gives an arbitrary element of the sequence (a function of the index). Surprisingly, implementing a proceedure to calculate values of the sequence is a rather rich source of technical challenges. This is my personal collection of implementations, and some notes on their properties.
